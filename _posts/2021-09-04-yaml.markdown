YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language. It is super set of JSON. Therefore every JSON can convert to YAML but not the way around.

### Feature
```yaml

#Map
key : value

#Nested map
parent_key :
  child_key1 : value1
  child_key2 : value2

#Sequence
list_of_sth:
 - first_item
 - second_item
 - thrid_item

#Mutiline string
mutiline_newline : |
  this is consider and newline
  and "Newline" character is preserve

mutiline_folded_string : >
  this is consider as folded string
  newline'll be replaced by space

#Document separator
doc1
---
doc2

```
