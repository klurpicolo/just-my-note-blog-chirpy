## Network
For bare Docker application, We have to expose port to host machine then another application can access it using hostIP:port. This is find but not suit well in cluster environment like K8s because Pod is considered as ephemeral resource which means its IP isn't consistent.

## Service
Service is an abstraction layer on top of Pod. It helps application client to access application(Pod) without knowing Its location(IP). For external access, see Ingress.
