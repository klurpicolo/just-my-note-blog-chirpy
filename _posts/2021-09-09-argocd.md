## Argocd
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It offers both command line interface and GUI.

## When to use Argocd
- We can deploy any application to K8s using just Kubectl but this way is error prone and tedious. To solve that, we can use Pipeline to help automate deployment process but with Argocd we can sync Git with actual infra in much better way.
- In case that we want to track infra application that we deploy in K8s. For example, our cluster needs Redis, Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ. we can deploy them using Argocd and helm to cluster.

## Alternative
- Flux
